# Extract RSS

A tool for turning a webpage into an rss feed.


Many websites do not have an rss feed, and there are a few paid services that
solve this problem by parsing a page and creating a feed.


This tool will generate rss feeds from a website, although you 
have to write the code to select articles and article details (examples in `sources.lisp`).

An example containg feeds generated by this can be found [here](https://github.com/NoamZeise/xml-feeds). 
You can then point your rss reader to the raw file, like [so](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NoamZeise/xml-feeds/master/lol-devblog.xml).

# Using

You can run `add-feeds.lisp` as a script periodically, it takes a path to a git repo. see `cron-examples.txt` for commands for some common lisp implementations.
It will add the xml feed files to that path, update the repo and push the changes.
